# opencv-tkinter

Hi! This is a little side proyect that I made to try different opencv functions and conbinations using a visual GUI made with tkinter. Like I said, it's just a side project, it's full of bugs and there're a lot of things that could be improved, i'm just lazy but if you want to open an issue or contact me feel free to do it! 

The general idea is that some times is hard to visually see the transformations that opencv is doing, or how they affect each other. So, by adding a simple GUI, it's easier to play with the parameters, make some changes and discover useful transformations for your own project

## Usage
```
python3 opencvgui.py
```
## TODO

I'm planing on: 
- Fixing all bugs (easier say than done)
- Make the GUI a little nicer 
- Add a video functionallity 
- Add more cv2 funcions and also a object detection integration like YOLO
- A button to download the code (for fast integration and testing)
